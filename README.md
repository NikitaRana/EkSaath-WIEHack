# EkSaath-WIEHack
A web application to cater to women who have had career breaks and are willing to get back to the professional world.

Problem Definition:

“43% of highly qualified women with children are leaving careers or off-ramping for a period of time” 
The aforementioned statistics has been stated in the book named as Lean In: Women, Work and Will to Lead by Sheryl Sandberg. 
The proposed solution focuses upon this specific section of women society who feel under confident, unskilled in comparison 
to the current industry skill standards only because they had to leave their beloved jobs to become a homemaker and take care 
of their family. The solution benefits these women by giving the chance of getting back to their professional with the help 
of a proper mentorship. 

Project Presented at BVPIEEE Women In Engineering WIEHack 2018 held at Bharatiya Vidhapeeth College of Engineering on
4th - 5th October 2018.
